------------------------------------------------------------

Case Title: prayut chan-o-cha
Docket No.: HC-2026-001
Date: 19 February 2026

------------------------------------------------------------

**I. BACKGROUND**

This opinion concerns the political and military career of Prayut Chan-o-cha, a former Thai military officer who served as Prime Minister of Thailand. His tenure in power was marked by a significant period of military rule followed by an elected term, encompassing both periods of cooperation and authoritarian governance.

**II. ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION**

The primary issues for determination involve identifying and evaluating the notable actions and consequences associated with Prayut Chan-o-cha's leadership, categorizing them as either positive or negative impacts, and providing a comprehensive analysis of his historical role.

**III. FINDINGS OF FACT (POSITIVE)**

Prayut Chan-o-cha sought to moderate his profile and cooperated with the elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra in 2011. Following the 2019 general election, he was elected as prime minister. After his political retirement, he was appointed a Privy Councilor. He formulated "twelve values" based on traditional Thai values and suggested their inclusion in school lessons. Furthermore, he acknowledged Lisa (rapper) for her contributions to spreading Thai culture globally, honoring her as a cultural ambassador leader. His government was also recognized for its work in national security management in solving the problem of the spread of COVID-19.

**IV. FINDINGS OF FACT (NEGATIVE)**

Prayut Chan-o-cha seized power in the 2014 coup d'état, subsequently becoming prime minister. In this capacity, he assumed control of the country as dictator and leader of the military junta, known as the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO). He issued an interim constitution that granted himself sweeping powers and provided amnesty for the coup. His regime was characterized as authoritarian, implementing a significant crackdown on dissent. Measures were also put in place to limit public discussions about democracy and criticism of the government, including the imposition of censorship.

**V. LEGAL ANALYSIS**

Prayut Chan-o-cha's political trajectory presents a duality of actions. On one hand, there are instances of cooperation with an elected government, his eventual election as prime minister, and efforts to promote national values and culture, alongside his government's management of the COVID-19 pandemic. These actions suggest a capacity for governance within established frameworks and a focus on national well-being and cultural promotion. However, these aspects are fundamentally juxtaposed with his initial seizure of power through a military coup. This act established an authoritarian regime where he functioned as a dictator, granting himself extensive powers and amnesty, while simultaneously suppressing dissent and implementing censorship. The transition from military rule to an elected position, while occurring, does not negate the foundational act of overthrowing a democratic government and subsequently governing with authoritarian measures. The positive contributions, while present, must be viewed within the context of a leadership that originated from and maintained elements of undemocratic control.

**VI. VERDICT**

Prayut Chan-o-cha sought to moderate his profile and cooperated with the elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra in 2011. He was elected as prime minister following the 2019 general election and was appointed a Privy Councilor after his political retirement. He formulated 'twelve values' based on traditional Thai values and suggested their inclusion in school lessons. He also acknowledged Lisa (rapper) for her contributions to spreading Thai culture globally, honoring her as a cultural ambassador leader. His government was recognized for its work in national security management in solving the problem of the spread of COVID-19.

However, Prayut Chan-o-cha seized power in the 2014 coup d'état, becoming prime minister, and assumed control of the country as dictator and leader of the military junta (NCPO). He issued an interim constitution granting himself sweeping powers and amnesty for the coup. He led an authoritarian regime with a significant crackdown on dissent and implemented measures to limit public discussions about democracy and criticism of the government, including censorship.

**VII. INTERNATIONAL LEGAL QUALIFICATION**

Upon careful review of the negative findings pertaining to Prayut Chan-o-cha, the panel has assessed these actions against the established frameworks of international criminal law, including the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), the Geneva Conventions, and the customary international law principles governing Crimes Against Humanity, War Crimes, Genocide, and the Crime of Aggression.

The negative findings include:
*   Seizing power in the 2014 coup d'état and becoming prime minister.
*   Assuming control of the country as dictator and leader of the military junta (NCPO).
*   Issuing an interim constitution granting himself sweeping powers and amnesty for the coup.
*   Leading an authoritarian regime with a significant crackdown on dissent.
*   Implementing measures to limit public discussions about democracy and criticism of the government, including censorship.

**Evaluation:**

1.  **Crimes Against Humanity:** These crimes require a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack, and typically involve acts such as murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, sexual violence, persecution, or other inhumane acts. While the establishment of an authoritarian regime, crackdown on dissent, and censorship represent serious violations of fundamental human rights, the provided negative findings do not detail specific acts that unequivocally meet the high threshold of severity and systematicity required to constitute Crimes Against Humanity under Article 7 of the Rome Statute. For instance, "persecution" as a crime against humanity requires severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law, and while suppression of dissent and censorship are grave, the findings do not specify the extent of physical harm, widespread arbitrary detention, or other inhumane acts that would elevate them to this category.

2.  **Genocide:** This crime involves acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such. None of the reported actions suggest any intent or commission of acts that would qualify as genocide under Article 6 of the Rome Statute.

3.  **War Crimes:** These crimes occur in the context of an armed conflict and involve grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions or other serious violations of the laws and customs applicable in international or non-international armed conflict. The negative findings do not describe any actions committed by Prayut Chan-o-cha in the context of an armed conflict. The seizure of power through a coup d'état, while involving military force, is generally considered an internal matter unless it escalates into an armed conflict with specific international law violations.

4.  **Crime of Aggression:** This crime involves the planning, preparation, initiation, or execution of an act of aggression, typically referring to the use of armed force by one state against the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of another state. A coup d'état, being an internal seizure of power, does not fall under the definition of the Crime of Aggression as defined by Article 8 bis of the Rome Statute.

5.  **Geneva Conventions:** The Geneva Conventions protect victims of armed conflict. The reported actions do not fall within the scope of these conventions.

**Jurisdiction and Retroactivity:** It is also pertinent to note that the International Criminal Court's jurisdiction is not retroactive. The Rome Statute entered into force in 2002. While the events in question occurred in 2014, Thailand is not a State Party to the Rome Statute. Therefore, the ICC would not have jurisdiction over these events unless the situation was referred by the UN Security Council.

**Conclusion:**
Based solely on the provided negative findings, which describe a military coup, the establishment of an authoritarian regime, suppression of dissent, and censorship, these actions, while representing grave violations of democratic principles and human rights, do not, in themselves, meet the strict legal thresholds for prosecutable international crimes (Crimes Against Humanity, Genocide, War Crimes, or the Crime of Aggression) under the Rome Statute or other instruments of international criminal law. The findings lack the specific details regarding the widespread or systematic nature and severity of acts against a civilian population that would be necessary to establish such crimes.

**Therefore, no prosecutable international crime would likely be established based on the information provided.**

**VIII. HYPOTHETICAL SENTENCING OUTCOME**

Given the determination that the negative findings concerning Prayut Chan-o-cha do not meet the legal thresholds for any international crimes under the Rome Statute or other instruments of international criminal law, there is no basis for a hypothetical sentencing outcome by an international tribunal.

In the absence of established international criminal liability, the concept of sentencing by an international court is inapplicable. Any potential legal consequences for the actions described would fall under relevant national jurisdictions, constitutional law, or human rights mechanisms, depending on the specific nature of the alleged conduct and the legal framework of the state in question.
